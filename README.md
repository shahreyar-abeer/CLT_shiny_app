# CLT_shiny_app

This is a shiny app created as part of final project of the course "Developing Data Products" from "The Johns Hopkins University".  

This app gives an intuition of the famous **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** by visualizing various distributions and how their mean is distributed simultaneously.  

**The CLT states that** the sampling distribution of the mean of any random variable will be approximately Normal, given that the sample size is large. We will try to get the intuition through this app.


**In order to use the app,** choose a distribution(say Normal) from the drop down menu and change the sample size gradually to observe how the distribution of the mean of x changes!
